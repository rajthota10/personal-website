Hello! I'm Raj, an aspiring software engineer/quant/product manager based in the San Fransisco Bay Area.

I'm a staunch believer of the philosophy that knowledge is only worth something when employed for the betterment of society. Growing up in the silicon valley, I've seen firsthand just how much technology has revolutionized society, and I hope to harness this potential for good in any product I work on. 

Currently, I'm a student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a dual degree in EECS (Electrical Engineerning & Computer Science) and Business Administration through the <a href="https://met.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program</u></a>.
